            <p class="informacao">
                Gasaá Cinca has been progressing on his training in a rather quick fashion and has quickly risen to the top as one of the most honorable pilots of this decade.

            <p class="informacao2">
                Although many of his personal information, like his real gender and family, are missing, we can assume a lot of great discoveries are going to be made by this member of the Hop Clan! Does this angry crested individual have any secrets? A hidden intent behind all of its findings?
            </p>
            <p class="informacao2">
                Many wish to know more about this special pilot! But hardly anyone is able to talk to this Hop member because it is always out and about on its adventures! The few who could talk a little bit with this fellow pilot said he was very impatient and that he was always looking out for something, like he knew something that others didn't.
